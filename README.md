Greetings, I am [Juan from San Juan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasencio/) 👋, 

I am a Fullstack developer, currently working for Carte's MVP; an Innovative digital menu and ordering platform built for restaurants. 

I helped set everything from the ground up that allows a restaurant's menuEditor to manage their restaurant's menu items. They can see their menu items via rendered cards (mobile friendly), and path to add/edit menu items details such as name, price, description, images, ingredients, tags, etc. Implemented dynamic frontend dropdowns, cards, tables, and rendered data that allow restaurant administrators to analyze, create, and edit data in the database. 
(see Carte React repo)

Of course, I created all necessary tables, stored procedures, and diagrams to manage (create, read, update, delete) menu items. Designed and maintained relational databases, stored procedures and user defined tables using 
MS SQL Server Management Studio while managing database resources to ensure satisfaction of unique data requirements and preventing duplicate data.
(see Carte SQL repo)

I also I created all necessary models, services, and controllers to connect API calls to access data in the CARTE database. Utilized ASP.NET MVC to build models in C# designing model routing, model validation, and 
dependency injection to validate data during my work on this web application. Created controllers in ASP.NET to pass data to our View in React.js utilizing JavaScript, 
Bootstrap, CSS, and basic HTML5. 
(see Carte .NET repo)

Established application with a team in AGILE environment, regularly using source-control (Git and GitHub) and participated in daily scrum meetings, peer code reviews and team code talks to ensure 
code quality and continuity. Enthusiastically engaged with my development team throughout the Software Development Life Cycle utilizing peer planning sessions, code reviews, virtual pair programming, source control process, 
Sr Dev-Jr Dev interactions, and peer-peer testing.
